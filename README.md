# Business Site

I have build a Business Site for my own fantasy company that I named GOitaly. It containes a Navbar, hero image, signup form, accordion and a footer. To make the accordion work i have use some JavaScript.

## The problem

My biggest problem in this site was to work with JavaScript for the first time. I haven't really understand it yet, so i took some help from Maks code from the code session. Next time i hope to make my site more "spicy" and still understand what im doing.
